    "title": "Measurement of 5-Year Electric Taxi Evolving Patterns",
    "content": "In this work, we make the first effort to understand the long-term evolving mobility and charging patterns through a five-year study on one of the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric taxi network in China. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.",
