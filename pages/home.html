<p>Xiang Liu is an Assistant Professor in Transportation Engineering at Rutgers University. He is also affliated with the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT), one USDOT-designated national university transportation center. Xiang received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), with a focus on rail safety and risk analysis. His work develops an integrated risk management framework for maximizing rail safety (particularly hazardous materials transportation) in the most cost-efficient manner. Some of his research results have been used by the American railroad industry in development of several recent rail safety policies and practices.</p>

<p>Xiang's research aims to improve the safety, efficiency and resiliency of transportation systems, with a current focus on freight and logistics systems. He, his students and his colleagues endeavor to advance the state of the art in four inter-related areas: 1) Transportation Accident Analysis and Prevention; 2) Risk Analysis of Energy Transportation; 3) Optimization of Infrastructure Management; and 4) Transportation Statistics and Data Mining.</p>
